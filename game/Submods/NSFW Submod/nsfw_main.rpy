        # Sexting prompts for your most 'risque' options

        # We identify five categories ("types", 1st element of the tuple) that the player's prompts fall into.

        # 1. compliment - The player says something nice to Monika.
        # 2. statement - The player makes some kind of declaration about their current state, what they're doing, how horny they feel, etc.
        # 3. command - The player tells Monika to do something (that she is physically capable of doing right now) or masturbate in some way.
        # 4a. desire_p - The player wishes to do something to Monika (but cannot physically do right now because they're on different sides of a screen).
        # 4b. desire_m - The player wants Monika to do something to them (but it's something that physically can't be done right this moment).

        # The "subtype" (2nd element of the tuple) allows the response to be more specific.
        # The subtype is independent from the type. But of course, only certain combinations of types and subtypes will be used.
        # Some are more common than others.

        # Subtypes are encoded with these crappy, cryptic three-letter tags. Each prompt has only one tag - try to pick the most specific one possible.
        # If you don't know what to pick / don't want to bother with this just pick "GEN".
        # Not all will be used but I have listed the codes here for future expansion.

        # "GEN" - Generic, use this for lines with no specific subtype.
        # "KIS" - Special subtype for prompts that should immediately trigger a kiss.

        # F - foreplay and nonpenetrative actions
